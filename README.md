# Formating and Hosting a Resume

## Purpose
This document will demonstrate the practical steps of how to host and format a resume using different technologies(or software). We are going to use markdown language for editing, a markdown editor, Github pages and Jekyll(a static site generator). Futhermore, this document will also entail general principles of current Technical Writing, as
explained in Andrew Etterâ€™s book Modern Technical Writing and relate to the practical steps which we are going to follow.

### Prerequisites

Requirements to fulfil this project
* **Markdown Editor** :- You would require a basic markdown editor which can be [Markdown Pad](http://www.markdownpad.com/)(as suggested by Andrew Etter) or [stackio](https://stackedit.io/)(an online collaborative markdown editor)
* **Resume formatted in Markdown** :- We would require a resume formatted in markdown language and tutorial on how to use markdown is attached in the [**More Resourses**](https://github.com/kamarabbas99/kamarabbas99.github.io/blob/main/README.md#more-resourses) section.

### Instructions
1. **Creating resume**
First of all you would require a resume formatted in a ightweight markup language known as markdown language. According to Andrew Etter, "The entire point of lightweight markup is to make it easier to produce well-formed XML, and we need XML in order to build websites." Additionally, Markdown is the most widely used lightweight markup language in the world2 and has the cleanest syntax. Therefore we will be using this language to create the resume so we can build a static site for hosting our resume later on. Any editor mentioned in the [**Prerequisites**](https://github.com/kamarabbas99/kamarabbas99.github.io/blob/main/README.md#prerequisites) section can be used which has a live preview tool to track your progress.
This gif shows live preview in StackEdit which is a really cool feature.

2. **Making github account** :- We are going to be using Github as it is most widely Distributed Version Control in the market. Etter metions in his book that, " DVCS(Distributed Version Control) have better performance, allow for offline work, and are superior for concurrent work on the same file. For technical writers, the most important reason to use DVCS is that developers prefer them." Resume and most of the other documents needs to be updated regulary and hence a using a DVC can be really helpful to keep track of the progress.</br>
  *  Go to github.com and click on **signup for github**

3. **Creating Repository** :- After creating github account signin using the credentials.</br>  
   * On the main page click on new beside the repository section
   ![Repo](https://github.com/kamarabbas99/kamarabbas99.github.io/blob/main/media/Screenshot%202021-11-02%20180053.png)
   * Enter the repository name as username.github.io
   ![Name](https://github.com/kamarabbas99/kamarabbas99.github.io/blob/main/media/assig2.gif)
  </br>   **Note** :- you cannot use any other name as repository name.
4. **Uploading resume** :- To the newly created repository the resume can be uploaded by Add file-> Upload files
![Upload](https://github.com/kamarabbas99/kamarabbas99.github.io/blob/main/media/assig3.gif)
   **Note** :- The name of the resume file should always be index.md as it is a requirement for the next step.
You can also upload a readme.md file or choose to edit the default readme.md provided by github.
6. **Hosting it using Github pages**:- As Andrew Etter said, "You should build and host a website, not distribute PDFs, but it bears repeating. Even the best documentation, like software, eventually goes out of date." Therefore we can create a static website and host it on github pages. Etter further added that static websites are simple, portable, secure and have no database or server side dependencies. Github pages is really cool static site generator and also provides some of the jekyll themes. If you want to use your own custom theme then refer to the link in  [**More Resourses**](https://github.com/kamarabbas99/kamarabbas99.github.io/blob/main/README.md#more-resourses) section</br>
  Go to settings from the repository page
  ![settings](https://github.com/kamarabbas99/kamarabbas99.github.io/blob/main/media/S4.png)
  Then, click on pages
    ![pages](https://github.com/kamarabbas99/kamarabbas99.github.io/blob/main/media/S5.png)

   Select the theme from a list of jekyll theme available
     ![Theme](https://github.com/kamarabbas99/kamarabbas99.github.io/blob/main/media/assig4.gif)

   
   You can then click on the link generated above to view your resume
   ![link](https://github.com/kamarabbas99/kamarabbas99.github.io/blob/main/media/Screenshot%202021-11-02%20195121.png)
   And Done! Get ready to be hired.</br>

## FAQs

1. Why is Markdown better than a word
processor?</br>  

	 _According to Andrew Etter, "Documentation with any sort of lifespan needs to be kept in version control, which Word's DOCX file format (a compressed collection of XML files) actively opposes." Using Markdown helps us establish two main principles of etter_
	    * _Storing the document online using a version control._
	    *  _Deploy the documentation using a static site genrator(Jekyll and/or github pages)_

2. Why is my resume not showing up?</br>  

	_There can be mainly two reasons for resume not showing up._
	   * _Make sure the name of your repository is in the format username.github.io_ 
	    * _After commiting it might take several minitues(10-20 mins) to actually reflect those changes on the live site. So wait for few more minitues then open the website and press Ctrl+Shift+R to refresh the page and clear cache from the previous visit._
