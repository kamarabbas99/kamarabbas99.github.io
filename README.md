### Prerequisites

Requirements to fulfil this project
* **Markdown Editor** :- You would require a basic markdown editor which can be [Markdown Pad](http://www.markdownpad.com/)(as suggested by Andrew Etter) or [stackio](https://stackedit.io/)(an online collaborative markdown editor)
* **Resume formatted in Markdown** :- We would require a resume formatted in markdown language and tutorial on how to use markdown is attached in the **More Resourses ** section.

### Instructions
1. **Creating resume**
First of all you would require a resume formatted in a ightweight markup language known as markdown language. According to Andrew Etter, "The entire point of lightweight markup is to make it easier to produce well-formed XML, and we need XML in order to build websites." Additionally, Markdown is the most widely used lightweight markup language in the world2 and has the cleanest syntax. Therefore we will be using this language to create the resume so we can build a static site for hosting our resume later on. Any editor mentioned in the **Prerequisites** section can be used which has a live preview tool to track your progress.
2. **Making github account**
4. **Creating Repository**
5. **Uploading resume**
